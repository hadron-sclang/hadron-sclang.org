title: Hadron SuperCollider
description: Hadron is a new implementation of the SuperCollider programming language interpreter.
---

Hadron is a re-implementation of the [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) language interpreter,
designed to Just-In-Time (JIT) compile SuperCollider code into machine code instructions. Hadron is in
early development stage and is not ready for use, but will hopefully one day be useful for the SuperCollider community.

As Hadron nears production this website is intended to serve as a documentation source for any documentation and news
regarding Hadron specifically. But for now this site will host a few research reports and articles about
the exising SuperCollider language implementation and SC development in general.
